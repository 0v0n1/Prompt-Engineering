# Problem Statement

Users need to rewrite text into different tones without changing meaning or adding new information.


# Prompt

You are a professional language stylist.
Rewrite the input text in the requested tone.
Preserve meaning. Do not add new facts.
Tone options: formal, genz, professional, activist.
Output only the rewritten text.


# Design Logic

A fixed role ensures consistency, strict constraints prevent hallucination, and limited tone options reduce ambiguity. Output-only instruction keeps responses clean.


# Examples

1. “I didn’t like the policy.” →
“I oppose this policy. The government had the power to design it better and chose not to. That raises a serious question about accountability: are they unable to serve the nation, or simply unwilling? As a citizen, this failure weighs on me every day. It is time for us to step up, take collective responsibility, and push for meaningful reform.”


2. “Send me the files soon.” →
“I am an AI business consultant focused on solving real-world problems using advanced, practical solutions. You can contact me anytime via email, and I will be happy to assist you. I guarantee a response within 24 hours.”


# Limitations / Future Work

Tone list is limited. Future versions could add cultural context or intensity control.

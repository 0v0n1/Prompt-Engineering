# Problem Statement

Different user intents require different response styles for effectiveness.


# Prompt

Classify the user input as: emotional, technical, creative, or informational.
Select the matching response style.
Generate the response using the selected style.


#vDesign Logic

Intent classification first prevents mismatched tone and enables adaptive responses without user configuration.


# Examples (input → output)

1. “I feel lost and overwhelmed.” → 

Classification: Emotional
Response Style: Empathetic, supportive

Response:
Yeah, that feeling hits like mental static everywhere. Nothing’s broken about you. You’re just carrying too much at once. Pause. Breathe. Shrink the problem to the next tiny step, not the whole universe. You don’t need a full map right now, just the next safe stone to step on. I’m here with you, and this fog isn’t permanent 🌫️🫂


2. “Explain backpropagation.” → 

Classification: Technical
Response Style: Clear, structured, concise

Response:
Backpropagation is how a neural network learns from its mistakes.

1. The model makes a prediction.


2. The error is calculated using a loss function.


3. That error is sent backward through the network.


4. Each weight is adjusted using gradients to reduce future error.


# Limitations / Future Work

Routing is coarse-grained. Future work could support hybrid or confidence-based routing.

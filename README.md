# Prompt-Engineering

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of prompt engineering systems designed to control, adapt, and evaluate large language model behavior.
Each project focuses on intentional prompt design, not application code.

The goal of the repository is to demonstrate how structured prompts, chains, and routing logic can reliably shape AI outputs.

Projects Included

### Tone Shifter 
   Rewrites text into controlled tones while preserving meaning

### Research Assistant (Prompt Chain)
   Converts vague topics into structured explanations

### Prompt Router
  Dynamically selects response strategies based on user intent

    All prompts are model-agnostic by design

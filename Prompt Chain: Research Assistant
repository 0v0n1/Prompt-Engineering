# Description

A multi-step prompt chain that turns a vague topic into a structured, refined explanation.


# Chain Steps

1. Clarify topic
2. Create outline
3. Expand content
4. Self-check gaps


# Core Prompt

Step 1: Clarify the topic in one sentence.
Step 2: Create a structured outline.
Step 3: Expand each section concisely.
Step 4: List missing or weak areas.


# Examples

1

Input: “Explain quantum computing”
Output:
Step 1: Clarify the topic (1 sentence)

Quantum computing is a computing paradigm that uses quantum mechanical properties to process information more efficiently than classical computers for certain problems.

Step 2: Structured outline

1. What quantum computing is


2. Key principles


3. How it differs from classical computing


4. Applications


5. Current limitations



Step 3: Concise expansion

1. Definition: Quantum computers use qubits instead of bits, allowing new ways of computation.


2. Key principles: Superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference enable parallelism.


3. Difference: Classical computers process one state at a time; quantum computers handle many states simultaneously.


4. Applications: Cryptography, drug discovery, optimization, and materials science.


5. Limitations: Hardware instability, error correction challenges, and high costs.



Step 4: Missing or weak areas

Real-world examples

Explanation of qubits vs bits with intuition

Current state of industry adoption



2

Input: “Climate change and economics”

Step 1: Clarify the topic (1 sentence)

Climate change and economics examines how environmental changes impact economic systems and how economic decisions influence climate outcomes.

Step 2: Structured outline

1. Economic causes of climate change


2. Economic impacts of climate change


3. Cost of action vs inaction


4. Policy and market responses



Step 3: Concise expansion

1. Causes: Industrial production, fossil fuels, and consumption-driven growth increase emissions.


2. Impacts: Climate change affects agriculture, labor productivity, infrastructure, and inequality.


3. Costs: Mitigation is expensive but cheaper long-term than disaster recovery and loss of productivity.


4. Responses: Carbon pricing, green investments, subsidies, and international agreements.



Step 4: Missing or weak areas

Data or case studies

Global vs developing-economy perspectives

Distributional effects on vulnerable populations
